Money manager software architecture typically involves several layers and components to handle various aspects of financial data processing, user interactions, security, and integration with external systems. Here's a high-level overview of a typical architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   1. User Interface (UI): This layer includes the interfaces through which users interact with the system. It may consist of web interfaces, desktop applications, mobile apps, or a combination of these.

   1. User Authentication: Handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system and its functionalities.

   1. Dashboard: Provides users with an overview of their financial data, including balances, transactions, budgeting information, and other relevant metrics.


1. **Application Layer:**
   1. Business Logic: This layer contains the core functionalities of the money management system. It includes modules for account management, transaction processing, budgeting, forecasting, reporting, and other financial operations.
   1. Workflow Orchestration: Coordinates the execution of various tasks and workflows within the system, ensuring proper sequencing and dependency management.

1. **Data Access Layer:**
   1. Data Management System: Stores and manages financial data, user profiles, transaction history, and other relevant information. 



1. **Security Layer:**
   1. Authentication and Authorization: Enforces security measures to verify the identity of users and control their access to system resources.
   1. Data Encryption: Encrypts sensitive data such as user credentials, financial transactions, and personal information to protect it from unauthorized access.




Layered architecture is well-suited for complex systems like money management software because it facilitates separation of concerns, allows for easier maintenance and testing, and supports incremental development and scalability. Additionally, it provides flexibility to swap out or upgrade individual layers without affecting the entire system.
